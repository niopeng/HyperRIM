# HyperRIM: Hyper-Resolution Implicit Model

[Project Page][project] | [Paper][paper] | [Pre-trained Models][pretrain]

PyTorch implementation of HyperRIM: a conditional deep generative model that avoids mode collapse and can generate multiple outputs for the same input.
The model is trained with [Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09087).
HyperRIM is able to:

- Increase the width and height of images by a factor of 16x
- Recover a plausible image from a badly compressed image
- Possibly do other things yet to be explored ðŸ˜ƒ
